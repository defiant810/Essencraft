#Essencraft


Welcome to the Github repository for the Minecraft mod, *Essencraft*, by the Colorado Coders team. This mod aims to add new items, blocks, and content to both the food and farming areas of Minecraft. Our eventual goal for this mod is to add a very large variety of food items, from basic plants to complex recipes, as well as new food related machines and blocks that will assist the user.

##Reporting Issues
* If you see an issue or run across a bug, please report it to us using the great issue tracker supplied by Github.
* The reporting system is for bugs only, please do not use it to submit general questions.
* Please include the version of the mod you are using in the issue report, as well as the version of forge and any other mods you may be using.
* Issues regarding ANYTHING that has to do with Optifine will be instantly closed and ignored. Optifine is not made to work with Forge or its mods, so if you are having an issue with mixing mods and Optifine, it is most likely Optifine's fault. Remove Optifine and see if that fixes the error, and then report it if the error persists.
* If you are a coder yourself, and realize that the bug can be easily fixed without getting us involved, by all means please fix it and submit a PR, we appreciate the help.
